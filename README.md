#Data Visualization
Uses matplotlib to visualize the data, such as histograms and box plots of the data with variable bin size. It can also create a Feature-by-Feature correlation matrix as well as a heatmap of the Data Point x Data Point matrix of the distance using lp norm.

Here's the source of the data

#KNN
K Nearest Neighbors
Question 1 uses the knn classifier with an 80/20 split of the data. Then it calculates the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the results. Question 2 compares different p-values for the distance function using the same metrics. See the write up for more detail.
